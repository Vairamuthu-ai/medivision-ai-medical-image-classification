## Project Description
Medivision AI is a Healthcare Artificial Intelligence project focused on medical image classification using deep learning.
The system classifies chest X-ray images into Normal or Pneumonia categories using transfer learning.

## Problem Statement
Manual analysis of medical images is time-consuming and prone to variability.
This project demonstrates how AI can support clinical decision-making by automating image classification.

## Dataset
- Chest X-ray Images (Normal vs Pneumonia)
- Public healthcare dataset from Kaggle

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- MobileNetV2 (Transfer Learning)
- CNNs
- Image Data Augmentation

## Project Workflow
1. Data loading and preprocessing
2. Image augmentation and normalization
3. Transfer learning with MobileNetV2
4. Model training and evaluation
5. Interpretation of healthcare relevance

## Key Learning Outcomes
- Applying transfer learning in Healthcare AI
- Building CNN-based medical imaging models
- Understanding clinical applicability of AI models
